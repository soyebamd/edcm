<P style="text-align: left;">Regardless of which type of moving estimate you get, you are best served by an accurate one. Show the estimator every single item to be moved, including items in the attic, basement, garage, shed, closets, and under beds. Reach a clear understanding about the amount of packing and other services needed. Anything omitted from the estimate but later included in the shipment will add to the cost. If circumstances change from the time of the estimate resulting in additional costs, the mover must provide an addendum to the estimate before performing the additional services.</P>

If there's a box or container that won't be unpacked right away, you and the mover should inspect it for signs of damage.&nbsp;Do not sign any delivery papers until you inspect your belongings and check them against the inventory.

<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>A Notebook and Pen to keep track of everything associated with the move</STRONG><BR>It is a good idea to pack one room at a time, labeling each box with the room name (Kitchen, Bathroom, etc.) and a number (Kitchen - #1). As you complete packing each box go to your notebook, record the room name and the box number and list the contents of the box. If you take a little extra time to do this while you are packing each box, being as specific as you can, it will make unpacking at your new home that much easier. Also, if a box goes missing during the move you will be able to identify the missing items immediately by referring to your inventory list.</P>

<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Black Felt Markers</STRONG><BR>The jumbo size, permanent ink, bold felt markers. Have two or three on hand as they tend to get misplaced especially if you have friends helping you pack for the move. Mark your Moving boxes boldly. Arrows indicating which end is UP on all sides of the box when the items you have packed must stay in the upright position. FRAGILE should be written on all sides of a moving box when the box contains fragile items.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Utility Knife and Scissors</STRONG><BR>For cutting cardboard and other packing materials.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Packing Tape and Tape Dispenser</STRONG><BR>Using proper packing tape on your moving boxes is very important. Other kinds of tape such as duct tape or masking tape do not adhere as well to cardboard boxes. We recommend 2 inch; wide plastic tape. A tape dispenser will make the job much easier and faster. Most moving supply companies offer a package deal &ndash; tape dispenser with 2-3 rolls of tape.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Packing tape is available in different grades and the price per roll generally reflects the grade type. As a note of interest, the very lowest economy grade of tape may not be your best value if the tape keeps tearing. You may end up spending more time trying to get the tape off the roll in one piece rather than sealing moving boxes.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Do not apply tape directly to polished or painted wood finishes. Removing the tape could ruin the surface. If you are attempting to secure dresser drawers or cabinet doors so they do not fly open when they are moved we recommend you use stretch wrap for this purpose.</P>
<HR>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG><BR>Packing Boxes<BR></STRONG>Whatever type of moving boxes you use (purchased or free) make certain they have a lid or cardboard flaps that completely cover the top so can tape the box completely shut.&nbsp;Keep the weight of your boxes at 50 pounds or less. Tape the bottom and top of every box.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Standard packing boxes that you buy come in various sizes and are generally offered for sale by the bundle.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Most moving supply companies will also buy back any boxes you do not use, so make certain you have a good supply of various sizes on hand before you start packing and keep the sales slip for any returns.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Wardrobe boxes come in two sizes, large/tall for hanging longer clothing items (gowns, dresses) and small/short for hanging shorter clothing items (suits, shirts). Wardrobe boxes are recommended for transporting all of your hanging clothing items.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Electronics boxes are specially designed for moving, shipping or storing televisions, VCRs, microwaves, stereo components, computers, monitors, and printers. If you have not kept the original shipping box for these items consider purchasing an electronics box and proper packing material for added protection during the move.</P>

<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Free boxes:</STRONG> Liquor store boxes are great for packing heavy items such as books or tools because they are relatively small and very sturdy. Copier paper boxes from work (with the lids) are also good packing boxes. Supermarket shipping boxes for fruits and vegetables are also good sturdy boxes. A word of caution, make certain these boxes are clean of debris (insects too) and dry before you pack any of your belongings into them.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Rubber/plastic type tote boxes are becoming a very popular alternative to the standard cardboard packing box for some items because they are waterproof, durable and reusable for everyday practical use after the move. They come in various sizes with lids, they have handles for ease of lifting and usually stack very well. If you use these tote boxes for packing, do not overload them just because they seem so durable. They still have to be lifted so keep the general rule of thumb in mind, should not exceed 50 pounds.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Packing Paper</STRONG><BR>If you use old newspapers to wrap your belongings and wadded up newspapers to fill in empty spaces in your boxes be prepared for the ink to rub off on your hands and also to rub off on anything else the newspapers comes in contact with. This means cleaning everything at the other end before you put anything away. Worse yet the ink may permanently stain some of your items. Use clean white newsprint.</P>

<P style="text-align: left;">Most moving supply companies sell this packing paper in sheets by the box and it is a relatively inexpensive investment to protect your personal belongings during the move. Size of the sheets may vary but generally a box will contain 150 sheets &ndash; 20&rdquo; x 25&rdquo;.</P>

<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Bubble Wrap</STRONG><BR>Bubble wrap is sold by the foot or yard and is available in various bubble sizes ranging from small to large. Smaller bubble size is recommended for delicate, lightweight items such as picture frames, glass or porcelain vases, crystal, glassware, figurines and knick-knacks. Larger bubble size is recommended for heavier items such as electronic or stereo equipment components, paintings or sculptures.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Packing Peanuts</STRONG><BR>Styrofoam or cornstarch packing peanuts are sold by volume by the box or in bags. Perfect as a cushion or filler when boxing up delicate objects. Great for packing electronics or other items sensitive to bumps and shocks. Many packing peanuts available today are environmentally friendly, biodegradable and anti-static.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Stretch Wrap</STRONG><BR>Stretch wrap is sold by the roll generally in two convenient sizes: Small, 5&rdquo; wide x 1000&rsquo; roll and Large, 18 inches wide x 1000 inch roll. This is a handy wrap that is ideal for bundling and securing all types of household items. Stretch wrap is very strong and form fits to any item you wrap. It sticks only to itself leaving no adhesive residue on the items wrapped with it. The small sized stretch wrap is ideal for securing dresser drawers and cabinets doors so they do not fly open while you move them. Wrap your furniture with the stretch wrap and your drawers and doors will stay firmly in place. Wrap cables with your electronics, ski poles to the skis, curtain rods and table legs together. The large sized stretch wrap makes wrapping larger furniture items and other bulky items fast and easy.</P>

If you would like to do it yourself, purchase a roll of 3.0 gauge plastic, cut it to completely cover your box spring and mattress and secure it tightly with packing tape (or duct tape).</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Sofa and Chair Covers</STRONG><BR>Protect your sofa, love seat and upholstered chairs from dirt and dust during your move. Most large furniture discount stores discard the shipping covers from new sofas and chairs once these items arrive at their store. Before you buy covers from a moving supply company, check with your local furniture stores as many will give you the covers for free.</P>

An average piano can weigh from three to five hundred pounds while full-sized upright pianos can weigh anywhere from five hundred to as much as a thousand pounds. Moving a piano it is not simply a matter of weight. It is the shape, the fragile outer cabinet, the intricate and delicate inner mechanics and the uneven distribution of parts. To move a piano properly, you must have the proper equipment and be knowledgeable about the unique dynamics of balance and inertia that pianos pose. Do not take unnecessary risks for yourself and your piano. Hire a professional.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>Pool Tables</STRONG> <BR>Hire a professional to do it right.

<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>How to pack:</STRONG> Back up all the files on your computer. Your computer company may recommend that you park your hard drive. That means using a special program (possibly called SHIP.EXE) that makes recording heads in the hard drive pull back from the data area into a safer area of the CPU. Check your operator manual for details.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Pack your disks in a separate box making certain not to pack anything magnetic in the same box. Bundle cables and wires and color code them to match the holes for easier reconnection in your new home.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">If your computer is completely cooled off, put each component part in a plastic bag to keep dirt out during the move. Place each piece inside the foam forms in their original boxes.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Fit cables and other accessories in the sides of each box and fill with packing peanuts. If you do not have the original boxes, use the double-box method. Fill the smaller of the two boxes with packing peanuts, put the bagged monitor or CPU in the middle, and fill the box the rest of the way so the component sits in the middle of the box without touching the sides.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Fit in cables and accessories, close and seal that box, then fill the bottom of the second box with packing peanuts, put the sealed box in, and fill all around the rest of the way with packing peanuts. If you have a small printer, you can pack it with your CPU. Be sure to remove the printer ink cartridges. If your printer uses pins to form-feed paper, leave the paper in during the move to keep the pins in place. Tape each box shut and boldly mark on all sides Fragile - Computer.</P>

Check your manual to make sure there are no special moving preparations you need to make to stabilize internal components. Wrap up the cord and secure it tightly with a twist tie.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">If you have the original packing box, complete with protective foam forms: Place your VCR into the box, place foam form on top. Tape the box shut securely. Boldly mark arrows pointing upward on all sides and label &ldquo;Fragile &ndash; VCR.&rdquo;</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">If you do not have the original packing box with foam forms for your VCR: Begin with a medium sturdy box. Purchase foam forms. Cut and contour the forms to completely cover all four inside walls of the box. Cut two more pieces, one for the bottom of the box and one for the top. Place one form in the bottom of the box and place the VCR inside on top of it. Completely fill any empty spaces between the VCR and outer contoured foam forms with tightly packed wadded packing paper (not packing peanuts). Place the last contoured piece of foam form on top of the TV. Tape the box shut securely. Boldly mark arrows pointing upward on all sides and label &ldquo;Fragile &ndash; VCR&rdquo;.</P>

Use color-coded tape to mark where cables and cords should go in the equipment for ease of set up when you get to your new home. Check your CD player manual to see whether you need to tighten screws that will keep internal components from moving around. If you have a turntable, tape down the platter the record sits on and tape the arm to the armrest (pack the plastic turntable cover separately from the turntable, if it comes off, or screw it down if it comes with that ability).</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Put all stereo components in individual plastic bags to keep them from getting dirty during the move and to keep packing peanuts out of the equipment.

<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>How to pack a big screen TV:</STRONG> Unplug your big screen TV and be certain it has cooled off. Lay it gently on its side and slide the foam forms on either end. Then slide it into the box and set it upright.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Tape the box shut and label &ldquo;Fragile &ndash; Big Screen TV&rdquo;.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">If you do not have the original box, you will still need more protection than packing peanuts provide. Dense foam blocks are much better for this type of job. Gently lay the TV on its side on top of a piece of foam.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Tape another piece of foam in the bottom and slide the whole thing into the box. Fill in all sides with foam. Tape the box shut and label &ldquo;Fragile &ndash; Big Screen TV&rdquo;.</P>

<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>What you will need:</STRONG> Tape, Original packing box complete with protective foam forms -or- tape, large sturdy moving box, large sheet of plastic, foam forms or packing peanuts, utility knife.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;"><STRONG>How to pack:</STRONG> Unplug your TV and be certain the interior elements have cooled off before you begin to pack it (3 hours). Check your manual to make sure there are no special moving preparations you need to make to stabilize internal components. Wrap up the cord and secure it tightly with a twist tie.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">If you have the original packing box, complete with protective foam forms: place your TV into the box, place foam form on top. Tape the box shut securely. Boldly mark arrows pointing upward on all sides. Boldly mark FRONT on the picture tube side of the box and label &ldquo;Fragile &ndash; TV&rdquo; on all sides.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">If you do not have the original packing box with foam forms for your TV: Begin with a large sturdy box. Purchase foam forms. Cut and contour the forms to completely cover all four inside walls of the box.</P>
<P style="text-align: left;">Cut two more pieces, one for the bottom of the box and one for the top. Place one form in the bottom of the box and place the TV inside on top of it. Completely fill any empty spaces between the TV and outer contoured foam forms with tightly packed wadded packing paper (not packing peanuts). Place the last contoured piece of foam form on top of the TV. Tape the box shut securely. Boldly mark arrows pointing upward on all sides. Boldly mark FRONT on the picture tube side of the box and label &ldquo;Fragile &ndash; TV&rdquo; on all sides. If you must use packing peanuts instead of foam forms be certain to completely enclose your TV in a large piece of plastic and seal it tightly at the top before placing it in the box containing the packing peanuts.</P>

Heat from the sun can raise temperatures inside a closed moving van to well over 150 degrees. Since vans travel through warm climates or high altitudes (both dangerous to pressurized containers) to reach their destinations, any article which may become explosive is prohibited from being placed in your shipment.</P>
